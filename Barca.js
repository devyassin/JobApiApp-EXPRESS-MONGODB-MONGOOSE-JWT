  "On September 2, 2019, FC Barcelona and Las Palmas reached an agreement for the transfer of Pedri. However, the Canarian player didn't join the blaugranes until August 2020. Born in Tegueste, Tenerife, on November 25, 2002, he began his football career in the team from his hometown.\
Later, he joined Laguna Youth and, from 2018, he began playing in the youth teams at UD Las Palmas. He excelled there and in the 2019/20 season he was a starter in the first team and the most used player across the season: 34 Segunda División A games and four goals.\
In his first season at the Club, Pedri made 52 appearances for Barça, more than any other player, establishing himself as a fixture in the side scoring four goals in the process. Such a great season has earned him the Golden Boy and the Kopa Trophy.\
Pedri's second season at the club saw him confirm his talent as one the best midfielders in the world despite an injury hit campaign.\
The midfielder quickly became a fixture in the Spanish national side and in 2021 he was chosen as the Player of the Tournament in the 2020 European Championships.\
In 2022 he was part of the Spain squad that reached the last 16 of the World Cup in Qatar.";
